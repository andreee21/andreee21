Hi! I'm André Sousa
If you are new here you might as well stay for a little search on my GitHub account.

I'm a teenager and a passionate self-taught backend and mobile developer from Portugal. I would love to do something cute for my portfolio but I am not that good with design.

🚀 I’m currently working on an app to find vegan products
📚 I’m currently learning Operating Systems' (Kernel) development and C
💙 My favorite technology is Python

⚡️ Fun fact: I started working at 14
